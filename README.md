**NO LONGER MAINTAINED I'm currently not interested in maintaining this project anymore, at least untill Stremio 5 has been officially released. This addon was rather an experiment than something that works concistently, due to Stremio 4 [limitations](https://github.com/sleeyax/stremio-discord/issues/2#issuecomment-578397666).**
